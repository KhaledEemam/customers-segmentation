# Identify-customer-segments
This project about identify customer segments, I used K-means unsupervised learning algorithm and Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to dimensionality reduction

# Steps of the project as follows:

1- Load The data

2- Preprocessing (Data Cleaning & engineering)

3- Feature Transformation (feature scaling and perform the PCA)

4- Interpret Principal Components

5- Clustering

6- Conclusion
